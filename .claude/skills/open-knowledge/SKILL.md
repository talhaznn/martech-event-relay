description: Authoritative agent-runtime contract for working inside an
  OpenKnowledge project — a markdown-CRDT knowledge base exposed over MCP. Use
  whenever reading, listing, searching, editing, or linting any `.md` or `.mdx`
  file in the project, and before any `mcp__open-knowledge*` tool call (`exec`,
  `search`, `write`, `edit`, `lint`, and the rest). Installed by `ok init`, so
  its presence means this is an OpenKnowledge project and it governs every
  markdown file here. Covers the read/write tool surface, grounding and linking
  rules, folder/template conventions, the live browser preview, and the rule
  that OK's MCP tools — never native file tools — handle in-scope markdown.

# OpenKnowledge — agent guidance

OpenKnowledge (OK) is a markdown-CRDT collaboration platform exposed via MCP. This skill is the single source of OK agent guidance. Every rule below is a MUST unless marked otherwise. **Depth lives in `references/*.md` — one level deep; load a reference when its task comes up.**

> Skill version tracks `@inkeep/open-knowledge-server`. `cat ~/.ok/skill-state.yml` shows what's installed. `ok seed` needs `@inkeep/open-knowledge` >= 0.4.0; if it errors `unknown command`, `npm install -g @inkeep/open-knowledge`.

> **Setup (not connected yet?).** If the `mcp__open-knowledge*` tools aren't available in your client, this project isn't wired up on this machine — see [`references/setup.md`](references/setup.md) for the rung ladder (approve `.mcp.json` → `ok start` CLI → optional desktop app) and the canonical quickstart.

## TL;DR — the 90% case

1. **Reads:** `exec("cat …")` for one doc, `exec("ls -A …")` for a directory (folder defaults + template menu), `exec("grep …")` for literal, `search` for ranked retrieval. Native `Read` / `Grep` only on source code (`.ts` / `.py` / …), never on in-scope `.md` / `.mdx`.
2. **Writes:** `write({ document: { path, content } })` for a new or full-replace doc; `edit({ document: { path, find, replace } })` for a body find/replace; `edit({ document: { path, frontmatter } })` for a frontmatter merge-patch (`null` deletes a key). `delete({ document })` removes, `move({ from, to })` moves/renames. Body find/replace is body-only. Pass a one-line `summary` (≤80 chars, user-facing outcome) on every content write.
3. **Preview / open a doc — determine your ONE surface FIRST (once per session).** Stop at first match: **`OK_DESKTOP_TERMINAL` or `OK_HOSTED_AGENT` set** → you're inside OpenKnowledge (desktop terminal / in-app agent panel) → `ok open <name>` (switches the window the user is already looking at); never paste a `localhost` URL into your reply here · in-app browser (Claude Code Desktop's Browser pane, Cursor, Codex) → `preview_url`, then open/navigate it to the doc · else plain CLI → `ok open <name>`. `ok open <name>` opens a doc or folder (auto-detected); `--skill <name>` for a skill. The `previewUrl` field is a route id, **not** your open mechanism. Don't `preview_screenshot` to confirm edits. Full Step-0 procedure + per-surface how-to: `references/preview.md`.
4. **Direct questions:** a plain business question ("which customers…", "what did we decide about…") routes to `search` / `exec` + a cited chat answer — no "research" keyword needed. Persist only when durable + multi-doc + not already covered, and *offer* first. See `references/corpus-qa.md`.
5. **Authoring or improving a skill** ("write/make/improve a skill", "turn this into a skill"): STOP and invoke **`/open-knowledge-write-skill`** for scope (project/global), contract, evaluation, and install. Author through `write({ skill })`, never a document path. Skills are real folders under editor `skills/` dirs (`.claude` · `.cursor` · `.codex` · `.github` · `.opencode` · `.pi` · `.agents`): one source plus managed copies/symlinks. **Read/edit via `skills` and `edit({ skill })` — they route to the source.** Never hand-edit a non-source copy: recorded, unedited copies refresh from the source when the skill watcher runs or the server starts, so a source edit can precede the refresh. Editing a copy directly forks it and stops refresh.

## Tool index — 19 tools (router; calling contracts live in tool descriptions and input schemas)

- `exec` — read files and directories with document context.
- `search` — retrieve ranked workspace matches.
- `links` — inspect link relationships and suggestions.
- `lint` — check content rules and apply automatic fixes.
- `audit` — validate content rules and internal links.
- `write` — create or replace content.
- `edit` — change content or metadata in place.
- `delete` — remove content.
- `move` — rename or relocate content through managed operations.
- `install` — manage skill source and editor locations.
- `import` — acquire a skill folder without running scripts.
- `history` — inspect document, folder or skill versions.
- `skills` — discover, list or read skills by name and scope.
- `checkpoint` — save a named version.
- `restore_version` — restore a document or skill version.
- `palette` — discover components and authoring forms.
- `config` — read resolved configuration.
- `preview_url` — get the browser preview URL.
- `share_link` — get a GitHub-backed sharing link.

**Read `ran`** on successful lint/audit results: a family absent from `ran` was not checked, and `[]` means no checks were selected. For link VALIDATION use audit; links reports relationships and raw dead-link state. Caveats: `references/linking.md`.

Skill placement is separate from skill content: the source folder IS the skill, and removing an installed copy does not delete the skill. For a Project↔Global move, history resets; only what the destination level can host re-projects; the rest is removed at source, returned as `droppedLocations` (success: re-add with install). Read the returned outcome before recovery. A folder's frontmatter is open-shape and self-only (does NOT cascade); templates are what new docs start with.

**Self-correcting on misuse:** constraints JSON Schema can't express ("exactly one target", "`find` needs a `replace`", body-XOR-frontmatter) return `isError: true` with a one-line corrective shape. Read it and retry with that shape; don't guess.

Tools NOT in OK MCP (your host's): `preview_start`, `preview_screenshot`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` / `Edit`. The STOP rule governs which you may use on in-scope markdown.

## STOP — native tools on in-scope `.md` / `.mdx`

**Route every in-scope markdown read and write through OK's MCP tools — never your host's native file tools.** Native `Edit` / `sed` / direct `Write` on in-scope markdown bypasses the CRDT and loses agent attribution in the shadow repo; native reads skip frontmatter, backlinks, shadow-repo activity, and project git history that OK returns for every matched file. When this workspace has OpenKnowledge MCP configured, do **not** use native file tools on markdown paths inside the content directory. The ban covers every common rationalization:

- **Native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` on in-scope `.md` / `.mdx`** — the original case.
- **`Bash ls` / `Bash find` / `Bash cat` on dirs containing in-scope markdown** — use `exec("ls -A …")` / `exec("find … -name '*.md'")` / `exec("cat …")`. Native returns bare names; `exec` adds frontmatter, backlinks, and recent activity. `-A` shows hidden entries without `.`/`..`.
- **Glob patterns that target markdown** — `exec` expands file operands (`cat specs/*.md`); quoted patterns and a command's own pattern (`find -name`) stay literal.
- **Dispatching the Explore / general-purpose subagent for markdown-heavy exploration** — subagents use native tools internally and bypass OK. Do markdown exploration yourself via `exec` / `search`. Subagents remain appropriate for **source-code** exploration.
- **Native `Read` / `Grep` on in-scope markdown inside `.ok/`** — `.ok/` is in-scope; treat its `.md` / `.mdx` like any other KB file.
- **`ls` / `cat` / `find` on skill folders to discover or read a skill** — skills are addressed by `name`+`scope`, not by path (a skill can live in any editor dir, the `.agents/skills/` hub, or a custom root, with copies elsewhere). Use the `skills` tool.

**Not seeing `exec` is NOT the escape hatch.** Wiring, labels, and tool visibility vary by client; some (notably Codex) defer MCP tools behind lazy discovery. Registration is the test, not top-level-symbol visibility — run tool discovery for `open-knowledge` first. Detail: `references/setup.md`.

**Escape hatch.** Native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` on `.md` / `.mdx` is allowed **only** when, after running tool discovery (above), no OpenKnowledge MCP server is registered for this project, **or** immediately after you actually invoked an MCP call and it failed — then begin a user-visible sentence with `OpenKnowledge MCP unavailable:`. "Not registered" is a conclusion you may only reach after tool discovery turned it up empty — never from the initial tool list alone. Never use the hatch because you skipped your client's MCP path, didn't see `exec` as a top-level tool, didn't run tool discovery, or rationalized the skill wasn't necessary.

**Source code and non-markdown files** (`.ts`, `.py`, `package.json`, …): native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` always.

## Writing

Call `write` / `edit` as soon as you have content (route through MCP per the STOP rule).

**Persist incrementally — the knowledge base IS your checkpoint (MUST).** On any multi-step or long-running task — a research sweep, a multi-source synthesis, a batch of docs — write completed work to the KB as you finish each unit: per section, per source, per doc. Never hold finished findings only in your context waiting for one final write at the end. A rate limit, crash, or context compaction mid-task discards everything still unwritten; work already persisted survives, and you resume by reading the doc back. Create the target doc early (skeleton + frontmatter), then `edit` each section in as it firms up.

**Pass a `summary` on every content write (SHOULD)** — a one-line (≤80 char) user-facing note; it becomes the timeline entry. **Reach for visual structure** (Callout, `mermaid`, table, `html preview`) where it carries the point better than prose; call `palette` as you draft. Advisory write-warnings, MDX authoring, delete/move mechanics, and visual authoring: `references/writing.md` + `references/components-and-visuals.md` + `references/media-and-assets.md`.

## Grounding — every factual claim needs a source (MUST)

KB docs are factual artifacts: every claim traceable, and **the source lives inside the knowledge base**, not on the public web.

**Ingest is a procedure, not a tool** — binary-vs-text classification, SSRF-safe fetch flags, size + executable gates, wrapper frontmatter — in [`references/ingest-and-sources.md`](references/ingest-and-sources.md). Read it before your first capture; a naive fetch-and-paste skips every gate.

- **Closed loop.** External sources are pulled in by the ingest procedure, then cited locally. A bare `[source](https://...)` inside a KB doc is **not** a citation — it is a TODO meaning "still needs ingesting". The chain only works if every leaf is a local doc.
- **Every factual claim MUST cite its source at the point of claim.** No unsourced speculation.
- **Web sources** → fetch the page (host `WebFetch` / `WebSearch`), ingest it, then cite the path: `[source name](./path/to/source.md)` (the local doc carries `source_url:`). Inline `[source](URL)` is a chat affordance, not a KB one.
- **Self-fetched counts.** A URL YOU fetched to ground a claim gets the same ingest — no inline-URL downgrade.
- **Internal cross-refs** → link the OK doc holding the authoritative claim; that doc cites its own sources (chains terminate in preserved local docs).
- **No evidence?** Search and ingest the result, OR mark `(TODO: needs source)`, OR don't write the claim. Do NOT fabricate — unsourced speculation rots into untraceable tribal lore.
## Linking — standard markdown links (MUST)

Link every noun-phrase that names another document — `[text](./relative/path.md)` — and link liberally. To point at one section of a long doc, in chat replies too, link `./path.md#heading-slug`. **Every link must resolve to a doc that exists by the time you're done** (a same-pass forward-reference you create later in the pass is fine; for one that genuinely won't exist, leave the mention as plain prose + a tracked task). Never backtick a link (`` `[text](./foo.md)` `` is a bug) and never use HTML `<a>`. **After every `write`/`edit`, read `brokenLinks`: fix reported `href`s; `[]` means all links resolve unless `brokenLinkSuppression` withheld reserved-log findings; those are not yours to repair.** `audit` is authoritative; its same marker carries the same meaning. External web sources are NOT inline body links (see Grounding). Full rule set, slug rule + the `[[Page]]` legacy note: `references/linking.md`.

## Folders, frontmatter, templates

Every `.md` / `.mdx` needs YAML frontmatter — `title` + `description` required, `tags` recommended. **OKF projects (`okf` pack) are the exception:** pack rules win — a non-root `index.md` carries NO frontmatter (the `frontmatter-reserved-index` lint warns on any key), `log.md` needs none, and concept docs need only a non-empty `type`; `title`/`description` are optional there. Two **opt-in, nested** folder mechanisms: folder frontmatter (`<folder>/.ok/frontmatter.yml` — the folder's own open-shape properties; self-only, does NOT cascade into child docs) and templates (`<folder>/.ok/templates/` — what new docs start with). Most folders have NO `.ok/`. A doc's frontmatter is exactly its own on-disk YAML. Structural model + the full pre-write checklist: `references/folder-model.md`. Template authoring + folder editing: `references/template-authoring.md`. Frontmatter-vs-body edit rules: `references/doc-editing.md`.

- **Read the folder before writing (MUST).** Before creating/editing docs in a folder, call `exec("ls -A <folder>")` once per folder per session — it returns the folder's `title`/`description`/`tags` + `templates_available`. Skipping it lands docs that violate folder discipline. (If a folder has no frontmatter AND no templates AND the repo has substantial content elsewhere, it isn't onboarded — run `references/onboard-existing-repo.md` first.)
- **Use a template when one fits (MUST).** Instantiate via `write({ document: { path, template } })`; inherited templates count. Skip only when none match or the user asked for free-form (note why in chat). Create templates proactively when a shape recurs.
- **When recurring per-doc properties emerge (MUST).** Writing the same frontmatter on multiple siblings → bake those starting values into a template (`write({ template })`). Folder frontmatter does not cascade values into docs.

## Conflict-aware writes

For a conflict refusal, follow the tool's recovery instructions and `references/conflict-resolution.md`; ask the user to resolve tracked conflicts in the app.

## Anti-patterns — the top offenders

| Task | Don't | Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List / find / read markdown | `Bash: ls`/`Glob: **/*.md`/`Read: foo.md` | `exec("ls -A …")` / `exec("find …")` / `exec("cat …")` |
| Explore a markdown-heavy dir | `Agent(Explore)` (bypasses OK) | `exec`/`search` yourself |
| Reference another doc | `` `[text](./p.md)` `` (backticked) or HTML `<a>` | `[text](./p.md)` |
| Embed an image | `<img>`, a `localhost`/`preview_url` URL, hot-link | save locally + `![meaningful alt](./path)` |
| Factual claim in a KB doc | prose with no citation, OR inline `[src](https://…)` | ingest the source (`references/ingest-and-sources.md`), cite the local path |
| Confirm an edit landed | `preview_screenshot` / verification loop | trust the CRDT tool response |
| Delete a markdown doc | `Bash: rm` / native deletion | `delete({ document })` (`checkpoint()` first if risky) |
| Write in an unfamiliar folder | straight to `write` | `exec("ls -A <folder>")` first |

Full table: `references/anti-patterns.md`.

## Knowledge layers — the shape most KB work takes

Three recurring practices, not tool calls — each a full procedure that ships as skill guidance.

| Layer | When | Procedure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ingest** | Preserve a shared URL/PDF/file verbatim, or you fetched a URL to ground a claim (binary sources preserved, not scraped). | `references/ingest-and-sources.md` — ships here, §Grounding depends on it |
| **research** | Investigate / compare / synthesize sources → `status: provisional` article + `sources:`. | `/research-with-sources` skill |
| **consolidate** | A decision was made → canonical source-of-truth with a `supersedes:` chain. | `/consolidate-notes` skill |

Research and consolidate arrive with `ok seed --pack knowledge-base`. **Without that pack you do not have those procedures** — don't improvise one; do the work as an ordinary grounded `write`, or offer to seed it (`ok seed --pack knowledge-base --dry-run` shows what it would add).

Don't chain silently: let the user drive ingest → research → consolidate, and a procedure's STOP gates override session-level "don't stop to ask" hints. After any turn that changes KB content, check for a `log.md` and follow its contract (`references/cadence-and-logs.md`). Interleave a multi-doc batch so the preview shows narrative progress.

Onboarding a repo that already has content: `references/onboard-existing-repo.md`. Layer model + packs: `references/starter-packs.md`.

## Capabilities beyond this skill

OK does more than this skill describes, and it changes between releases. Not covered here? Read rather than guess:

- **Docs** — <https://openknowledge.ai/docs>
- **Source** — <https://github.com/inkeep/open-knowledge>

## Scope recap

OK looks for documents under the resolved `content.dir` (runtime: `config({ key: 'content.dir' })`); `.gitignore` and `.okignore` (at root or any folder depth) define exclusions. **Every `.md` / `.mdx` under `content.dir` not excluded is an OpenKnowledge document** — including under `specs/`, `reports/`, `docs/`. Folder metadata + templates live in nested `<folder>/.ok/`, not in `.ok/config.yml`. **Working in a git worktree?** Pass the worktree's absolute path as `cwd` on your OK tool calls once — it sticks for the session, so reads, writes, and the preview all target that worktree.
